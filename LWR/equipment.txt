; -- Changes --
; Sawed-off shotgun unlimited item: done (I think)
; Auto weapons: add burst and suppress
; Additional ammo for most balistic weapons (assault rifle: 10; 
; Stun rifle backup weapon, and cheaper (10 creds), quicker (7), but more materials (10 Elerium=10, and 10 Alloys): done (I think)

; -- Actual code: DefaultGameCore.ini --

; Weapons: iSuppression value holds ammo, format xxyy, where xx is shots WITH ammo conservation; yy is shots WITHOUT ammo conservation
; Class Limitations:
; eWP_AnyClass: Any of the 8 fully human subclasses plus rookies, not MECs or SHIVs
; eWP_Support: Gunner
; eWP_Heavy: Rocketeer
; eWP_Sniper: Sniper. This affects weapon performance, so only use on sniper rifles and small items.
; eWP_Assault: Assault. This affects weapon performance, so only use on shotguns and small items.
; eWP_Overheats: Scout 
; eWP_UnlimitedAmmo: Engineer. This also grants unlimited ammo if used on a weapon that pays attention to the iSuppression variable, so don't use it on primary weapons or pistols if you want ammo to matter.
; eWP_Rifle: Infantry, Engineer, Medic, Assault, Scout
; eWP_Mec: MEC. Can stack with eWP_Integrated and any of the human limitations.
; eWP_Integrated: SHIV. Can stack with eWP_Mec and any of the human limitations. 
; eWP_Psionic: Psionic. Must also included a property opening it up to a regular class, such eWP_AnyClass, or it will be unequippable.

; cost and other variables

; Additional Item Stats and construction costs
; meld cost is above 4th and additional digits in iElerium
; perk granted is above 4th and additional digits in Alloys				

; extra weapon and armor stat configuration (in BalanceMods_Classic entries)
; eType		-- item ID (only numbers, eItem enum does not)
; iDamage	-- flight fuel, works only for weapons/items
; iCritHit	-- model size adjustment in three dimensions, xxxyyyzzz, where xxx is barrel direction, in % of baseline, so 110100100 is 10% longer gun. Only works on PRIMARY weapons.
; iAim		-- aim, works only for armors
; iDefense 	-- defense, works only for weapons and items
; iHP		-- damage resistance, works for weapons/armor/items xx = x.x DR, so 5= 0.5
; iMobility -- mobility, works only for weapons/items
; iWill		-- maximum % chance for item to be damaged after a mission in which the soldier was reduced to 0 hit points, chance is reduced as injury
